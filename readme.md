This is a JavaScript code snippet that demonstrates a simple product listing and shopping cart functionality. It fetches product data from a JSON file and renders the products on a web page. Users can add products to their cart, modify quantities, and calculate the total cost.

## **Usage**

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Include the JavaScript code in your HTML file or JavaScript project.

2. Make sure you have a JSON file named "Product.json" that contains the product data. The file should have the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Product 1",
    "price": 10,
    "picture": "path/to/product1.jpg"
  },
  {
    "name": "Product 2",
    "price": 20,
    "picture": "path/to/product2.jpg"
  },
  ...
]
```
3. Create a container element in your HTML file with the id "card-container" where the product cards will be rendered.

4. Create an empty table with the id "editrows" where the editable product rows will be rendered.

5. Include the necessary CSS styles for the product cards, editable rows, and cart items.

6. Initialize the code by calling the render() function.
